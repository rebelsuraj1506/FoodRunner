    <string name="s1">We value our customer’s time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be assigned to you shortly. You can also email us your issue on support@swiggy.in</string>
    <string name="s2">We have no minimum order value and you can order for any amount.</string>
    <string name="s3">Your order can be edited before it reaches the restaurant. You could contact customer support team via chat or call to do so. Once order is placed and restaurant starts preparing your food, you may not edit its contents</string>
    <string name="s4">We will do our best to accommodate your request if the order is not placed to the restaurant (Customer service number: 080-67466729). Please note that we will have a right to charge a cancellation fee up to full order value to compensate our restaurant and delivery partners if your order has been confirmed.</string>
